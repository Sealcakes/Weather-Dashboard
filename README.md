# Weather Dashboard

## Description

The weather dashboard is a simple tool that can be used to get up-to-date weather information based on a city search.  You can search for any city in the world and it will pull the most relevant data for the weather in that area for the current day as well as a 5-day forecast.  The weather dashboard will also keep a search history that persists via local storage of all your recent city searches.  Throughout this project I familiarized myself with local storage, api usage and some "fun" bug fixing methods.

## Usage

Just type in the city you would like to see weather information for and click search!
